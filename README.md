# Advance-EDA
Data Exploration with Sweetviz, Auto-Viz and y-data profiling

EDA is one of the most important things we need to do as an approach to understand the dataset better.
Almost all data analytics or data science professionals do this process before generating insights or doing data modeling. 
In real life, this process took a lot of time, depending on the complexity and completeness of the dataset we have. Of course, more variables make us explore more to get the summary we need before doing the next steps.

In Python, we can use these libraries:
1) ydata-profiling
2) dtale
3) sweetviz
4) autoviz

These Advance EDA python packages only shows us a summary, before we focus to explore deeper any variables we find “interesting”.
